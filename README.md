This is a generic skeleton project that can be used to quickly get a
new [MattKeeley](https://github.com/MattKeeley) Python library GitHub
project started. This skeleton project contains [licensing
information](LICENSE), as well as
[pre-commit hooks](https://pre-commit.com) and
[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) configurations
appropriate for a Python library project.
